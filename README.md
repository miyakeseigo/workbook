## Q8. (100 words) Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language

## Q9. (100 words) Explain type coercion

## Q10. (100 words) Explain data types, using examples

## Q11. (N/A words) Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”
 - Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem
 - Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified

## Q12. (100 words) Identify and explain the error in the code snippet below that is preventing correct execution of the program

## Q13. (N/A words) The code snippet below looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

## Q14. (N/A words) Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:
 1. Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations
 2. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart

 ## Q15. (N/A words) Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:
***You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.***

## Q16. (N/A words) An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:
 - eggs (1)
 - peanuts (2)
 - shellfish (4)
 - strawberries (8)
 - tomatoes (16)
 - chocolate (32)
 - pollen (64)
 - cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them:
<dl>
 <dt> a) whether or not they’re allergic to a given item
 </dt>
 <dt>
 b) the full list of allergies.
 </dt>
 <dl>
